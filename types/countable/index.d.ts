/**
 * How to use this library in typescript?
 *
 * If you want to use this library in terms of typescript module,
 * which means you want to import functions exported from this module to another module and invoke them later,
 * then you should add this library to your typescript code by expression `import * as Countable from 'path/to/this/project';`
 * or simply import functions which you want to invoke by `import { on, off } from 'path/to/this/project'`.
 * Since this library was written in UMD, imported-functions can be load by the module loader
 * which you have specified in tsc settings `module` from javascript source file `Countable.js` without occupancy of global namespace.
 *
 * The other way is to call this library in a non-modular javascript file through global namespace.
 * By calling 'non-modular' javascript file, it means that export and import expressions are not allowed in these js file,
 * otherwise typescript transpiler will report error.
 *
 * The first thing you have to do in this case is to let tsc know where is the javascript source file of this library by adding directives
 * `/// <reference path="path/to/countable/index.d.ts" />` on the top of javascript file which utilize this library.
 * After that you can invoke functions of this library from global variable `Countable` (e.g. `Countable.count(elements, callback, )`)
 * in your module without warning from development tool which perform type checking for you.
 * Notice that in case of importing Countable to global namespace, you will be responsible for concatenating the javascript file of this library
 * with your code if you want to, as well as link it to your runtime.
 *
